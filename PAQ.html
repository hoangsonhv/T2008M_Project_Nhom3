                                <p>First, you need to consider what occasions you will bring your new bag. Going to work, going out, going to a party can be the three most basic and prerequisite goals for you. You can choose a versatile bag to accompany you on many occasions such as Chanel Boy, Chanel 2.55, Loewe Puzzle, Celine Classic Box, Celine Triomphe ... Another option for you is a handbag for some schools. special combination. Will you choose a large work bag, a mid-sized shoulder bag for appointments, or a luxury hand bag for a party?</p>
                                <p>Budget balance is a difficult issue, but it is very necessary to help you find a "true love" handbag. You need to determine the amount of money you can afford, thereby making it easier to limit your search. For example, with a budget of about 30 million, you can refer to the Saint Laurent Circle Bag or Louis Vuitton Daily Pouch ...

While large bags are suitable for girls who need to bring the "whole world" with them. Some other unique designs such as the Jacquemus micro bag, the Prada baguette, the Dior saddle bag or, most recently, the Bottega Veneta's The Pouche bag offers a richer choice for the discerning girl. .</p>

                                <p>1. Research your brand name bag information carefully
                                    The best way to own a genuine handbag is to buy it directly from an authorized store or dealer. However, for brands that do not have regional stores that you can afford, genuine online websites will be an alternative.

                                    In case you want to buy handbags through other online sites, you should look for reputable ones. After reviewing the information, go to the place to check the label, origin, materials as well as every detail on the bag.</p>
                                <p>2. Beware of bags with “dream” prices
                                    Do not be mesmerized by the "virtual" numbers from branded selling websites. Before buying, double-check the original price of the bag on the brand's genuine website. In fact, many high-end and luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton and Hermès rarely offer discounts.

                                    So, if you find handbags that can be sold at "great" prices, be careful to be fooled. Chances are the designs are second-hand, not in perfect condition, or worse, fake.</p>
                                <p>3. Check the origin of authentic brand handbags
                                    Typically, high-end brands' handbag designs have words that show the place of manufacture. Gucci and Prada will be “Made in Italy” (made in Italy), Dior will be “Made in Italy” or “Made in Spain” (made in Spain) and Chanel, Louis Vuitton will be “Made in France. ”(Made in France).

                                    authentic brand handbags

                                    High-end brands rarely produce handbags in any other intermediary countries. If you notice the source of the product is "Made in China" or "Made in Cambodia", you should check carefully before deciding to buy.</p>
                                <p>4. Brand logo on handbag
                                    The features on the logo are the most effective way to differentiate between authentic and fake handbags. The Chanel logo will consist of 2 interlocking C letters and the letters are not altered in the same direction as the letter O like a fake handbag. The word "CHANEL" is usually engraved inside the bag with the words "Made in France" next to or just below.

                                    Similar to Chanel, the Os in the Louis Vuitton logo possess a perfectly rounded line, while fake Louis Vuitton handbags often use the oval O. Louis Vuitton is very delicate in arranging the logo on the handbag when arranging the letters Louis Vuitton completely symmetrical all over the product surface.</p>
